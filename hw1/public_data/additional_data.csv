0,"Hoodie + Coat - Yes or No?

As for me, there is nothing better and more convenient than such a couple for daily routine worries that have to be done more often than bright events happen😉🤷🏼‍♀️

While it is still not too cold, the coat can be left open. The hoodie can be worn without an underlayer. However, it is also not forbidden to pry off the turtleneck to save the throat and tighten the belt on the coat.

2,"How happy I am when the roads of trends and conveniences coincide❤️ Aesthetics here also passed very close, at least in my opinion, although aesthetics, of course, are more subjective😉

One of the most joyful fall 2022 shoe trends I've met is colorful sneakers 🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣 Bright, contrasting, a little crazy 🤪

And most importantly, don't limit yourself to styling them only in sports and casual. Colored sneakers will ideally relax a classic trouser suit. Аnd mix very well with a dress or a mini skirt (you can soften the transition from sneakers to the leg with white socks). Аnd ideally, complement the trendy midi or maxi skirt this fall.

As an illustrative example, I have collected the outfits of the local Italian star Chiara Ferragni, a well-known lover of bright sneakers. She even has a line of such under her own brand.

40,"And today we are talking about straight midi or maxi skirts. And here I will talk about fairly dense textures that hold their shape. First of all, of course, denim 💙, as an alternative there are cotton or thick linen. For these skirts, the trend of slits on one leg is relevant (this makes them more comfortable when walking), but in general this is not necessary.

The straight skirt creates the silhouette of a column, as we continue to visualize how to style this skirt - we have an extension on the top and bottom of the column, as well as for this skirt.

With straight midi and maxi skirts, any massive shoes and a loose top look great, but you can limit yourself to one of these elements, for example, by choosing a massive platform and complementing the skirt with a tight-fitting long-sleeve, or vice versa, neat flat shoes and an asymmetric skirt tucked into oversized shirt.

41,"And we are returning to the skirts, as promised. We will discuss, look at, and style each TOP for the summer of 2022.  And today - transparent skirts and mesh skirts are a hot hit.

At first glance, the trend is difficult to apply in real life, but it gets along well with the bottom layer:

- with trousers
- with an opaque skirt, it is natural that the lower skirt should be shorter than the upper one,

Well, if you have the courage😉:
-with a bodysuit,
- with a high-rise bikini.

Another opportunity to slightly reduce the degree of transparency is an elongated shoulder product - a masculine jacket, a long shirt, or even an oversized hoodie/sweatshirt.

An interesting 👌🏼 stylization is obtained with contrast knee-highs/stockings under a transparent skirt.

And I can give similar advices about transparent dresses, which are in no way inferior to mesh skirts in their popularity.

I am sure that among you, despite everything, there are adherents of calm monochrome - and today, total beige is a charming palette that gives peace and warmth. And in beige monochrome (as well as, in principle, in any other monochrome), contrasting textures are good - fluffy with smooth, shiny with matte, shaggy with leather, etc.

Well, if not total, then beige is beautiful with white and black, green (but not acidic😉), brown, and red. I also really like the non-trivial combination of beige with blue and with an animal print, for example with a cow🐄 or a tiger 🐯

A corset is a must-have in 2022, and depending on your preferences, it can be vintage, modern, or sporty.

I also suggest stylizing it in different ways. The main goal is to get away from direct boudoir association. Here are some ideas:

- maximum contrast - a corset with jeans (you can even torn ones) or joggers;
- classic - a corset for a shirt or blouse;
- neo-classic - a corset with a masculine suit;
- frankness - corset and mini;
- sexy - corset with leather bottom;
- surprise - a corset with cycling shorts.

Basic coats, masculine bombers, knitwear, vintage furs, and sheepskin coats, from the bright ones, perhaps, only accessories are found - in the face of scarves, hats, and gloves.

A bit of theory🤓 It so happened that historically our beloved men were ""assigned"" an H-shaped silhouette, i.e., without bright accents on the shoulders, waist, or hips. Over time, they also began to recognize the V-silhouette, emphasizing the shoulders. BUT! ☝🏼 Before our eyes, stereotypes are being destroyed, and men are actively offered the X-silhouette, which was previously considered the sexiest and most feminine (remember New look Dior).

At Prada, we see numerous accents on the male waist: drawstrings tightened belts, wraps, and tucks. All this is supported and exaggerated by deliberately wide shoulders and additional accents on the sleeves, with which the waist seems even more defined.

And most importantly🤩 Well, who's to say that performed by Prada it looks FI-how unmanly? No indeed! Never before has a ""feminine"" X looked so masculine!",0

I think that most of us know to whom we owe this - Bottega Veneta has given us more than one hot trend in recent years, including this one. This trend is often realized on Chelsea boots, but there are options for high boots and lace-up boots.

🟢 Options with a contrasting sole will be the most trendy.
🟤But if you are for more relaxed decisions, pay attention to shoes with contrast colors of the soles, but still not too much.
⚪️ The most ""basic"" will be a heavily textured sole (it seems to stand out, but not too much)

✔️ The most understandable way to style such shoes is to match some other detail to the color of the sole - it can be an accessory, a bag, or even outerwear.
✔️Another option is to leave maximum attention on the shoes and put together a total color outfit, where the sole will be the brightest accent.

1. Asymmetrically tuck into trousers/skirt (front or side) Be careful with thick and oversized sweaters. They can ""give"" unnecessary volume in the waist area.
2. Pull up the sweater sleeves - this can be done as high as possible (above the elbow). I especially like it if, at the same time, we leave the bottom layer unassembled - a turtleneck, a shirt, etc.
3. Throw it over the shoulders - this technique looks very relaxed when we use it on another (the most similar sweater). The sleeves can be tied together; asymmetry is welcomed - skip one edge under the armpit, not on the shoulder. By the way, the technique is also relevant for outerwear (trench coat, coat).
4. Don't try to wrap🙅🏼‍♀️ the collar of the sweater/turtleneck; on the contrary, we leave it carelessly gathered.

✔️Asymmetric clasp or any other unusual element
✔️ You can experiment a little with color and stop at calm, close to official- lavender, pale green, or at least pay attention to blue, pale pink, beige shades of shirts.
✔️ A slightly noticeable print can also become a feature. If a strip and a checkered print are already akin to the basis for a business style, then a print in the form of a repeating logo (this technique itself is very relevant in 2021) is already something unusual.

Here are some ideas to wear a jacket to make you don't appear to be naked.

✔️ beige bodysuit, top (maximum fit and color matching the skin will give the effect as close as possible to nudity). 
✔️ double-breasted jacket with NOT a very deep neckline (fasten it with all the buttons)
✔️ a small bralette, which you won't immediately notice if you fasten one button of a jacket at its level (ideally, also flesh-colored).

And at the last men's biker show, the same rules worked: sequins were mixed with oversized jeans, with Cossacks, with shoes with massive soles, with biker jackets and leather vests from the 90s.

So, the vintage boutique offers us a whole collection made from such Madame Pauline Vintage Bandana shawls-caftans, dresses, shorts, shirts, sweatshirts, bags, and even shoes in an infinite number of colors.

2. Accent frames and temples
If you are not ready to play with shapes but want to add brightness to your glasses, try to look at glasses with bright temples that will stand out and differ from the glasses' frame. The only limitation is that I do not recommend using rhinestones and gems as an accent. Let's focus on shape or color.

3. Eyeglass chains continue to be relevant and very comfortable. The choice is varied; such a chain is, first of all, a decoration, but only secondly - a functional.

If you want to add shine to your wardrobe (in the most literal sense), then here are some valuable tips:

1. The look with sequins looks perfect in monochrome color, and we take into account all the details, even accessories, and jewelry.

2. Play with textures to make them look interesting. A plain cotton T-shirt with a sequin skirt is an option for real life, but a festive blouse with such a skirt is only ""on the way out"" (and in this case, I would add an ""extinguishing"" element)

3. If you nevertheless decide to combine several parts from sequins in one bow, then act in the opposite direction from the previous rule - choose the most similar texture (sequins must be of the same size and shape).

🌱Give preference to natural fibers (and this is not only about linen and cotton, but modern technologies also make it possible to use hemp, rubber, and many other materials, unexpected at first glance, in the production of swimwear).

🌱Avoid primary plastic (choose swimwear made from recycled plastic);

🌱Pay attention to the dyes used to dye your swimwear - certified non-toxic dyes make our world a better place.

🌱Have to hand wash swimsuits - this will prolong their life and allow them to be used longer and more productively and reduce the effect of washing out of microplastics.

🌱 don't forget about recycling (hand over old swimwear for recycling)

🌱Choose brands that think about our future, I know that many people consider this to be empty talk, but even these are meaningful and make us feel, so start small😉",0

▪️Functional cut
▫️Minimum accessories, and if there are any, they also comply with all the principles of minimalism
▪️Basic calm colors (not necessarily black, white, beige, and gray, it can be other colors, but in their muted dusty form)
▫️ Absence of the most relaxed prints and decor

Prada, Gabriella Hearst, Loewe, Ganni, Michael Kors - these and not only these brands have implemented this trend in their summer collections in 2021, and, of course, the mass market is not lagging in this matter😉
 
❗️Be careful when choosing such shoes, because a low-quality, high and massive sole bends very badly and makes attempts to walk almost torture, therefore I urge you to pay special attention to convenience in this case already at the first fitting.

340,"Patchwork is back with us! Relevant for everything, starting with denim and continuing with jackets, shirts, trousers, bags, and more. If you think about it, there are three reasons why this is so:

✔️Back to the roots - ethnicity and patchwork are inextricably linked, namely, the desire for authenticity is now the main engine of fashion.

✔️After a hard year of imprisonment and quarantine, infantilism and brightness became an outlet and self-expression. Well, the patchwork satisfies both of these requirements - bright and a little childish😉

✔️ A conscious approach to consumption, recycling - you can say much marketing from the side of the industry or awareness of something fundamental. However, the fact remains that this is the main direction of fashion development today. Patchwork has historically been a solution to the lack of textiles and the latter's use to the maximum, this is inherent in it by nature itself👌🏼

9 Tricks That Will Make Your Look Feminine and Delicate: (Part 2)

5. Play with proportions - oversize the model or a deliberate increase in proportions will do (for example, increased sleeves).
6. Lightweight, NOT massive shapes. We use thin fabrics (chiffon, silk, satin, poplin)
7. We use natural fabrics such as linen, cotton, poplin, and others. It is these fabrics that bring us closer to nature, create an aura of romance and naivety.
8. As a decoration, we use ethnicity, sewing, lace, as well as natural fabrics, they make the image more delicate.
9. Light colors will be ideal - beige, white, light gray and all light shades of bright colors (light green, blue, pink and others). Bright colors in all their color can also be used. However, as accent colors, you should not make them basic.

342,"If you ask me about the most romantic and self-conscious modern brand, I will undoubtedly answer - Zimmermann. And the Resort 2022 collection is no exception. If you also want such aesthetics in your wardrobe, you can learn from them.🤓

So, 9 tricks that will make you look feminine and gentle:
(Part 1)

1. Volumetric shapes, contrasting with the shape of the body. In romance, there is no place for tight-fitting silhouettes.
2. Soft plastic - smooth transitions from one part to another. There are no corners and no rigid shapes.
3. Clothes silhouette - A or O. These two silhouettes evoke the necessary associations in us: femininity, tenderness, softness, and smoothness.
4. Smooth, rounded, and wavy lines. Flounces and ruffles, soft folds, and gathers will help us with this. With a minimum of vertical or horizontal lines, we focus on waves.

White belts were also noted - with a recommendation to select the perfect tone to match the outfit. I also like this combination, and summer is practically the only time when we can afford it.

✔️ Thin belts - in general, why not, primarily if we use the multi-layer effect, BUT!!! I saw in the same article a recommendation that such belts are suitable for short girls.😳 I was surprised... how long has the horizontal division of the figure helped us add height? 😏 In general, forget🙅🏼‍♀️ about accent belts if there is a desire to add height visually.

The ""danger""❌ of flip-flops as city shoes is that they visually highlight all the imperfections of the leg, so if you have such, then it is better to pass by this option. The bone on the thumb will appear even more significant in them, and a slightly bent little finger may generally seem skewed.

✅ Change the ""paper bag"" to shorts with pleats at the waist. If you are wondering, ""What's the difference?"" In the second version, the answer is that the folds are stitched and not created with the help of a belt; they are much more rigid and structured. By the way, the material for such shorts is also welcomed that keeps its shape.

✅ Summer novelty - knitted slightly ""vintage"" loose monochromatic options. For them, a scuffed and aged (slightly) look is welcome.

✅With us, leather options remain, the conditions are the same - a higher waist and no tight-fitting.

2. For all occasions👌🏼

Slightly more sporty and, accordingly, more often than not, a little more comfortable, suitable both for the city and for suburban activities. A massive sole and the presence of a not very catchy, not sports decor will help to get away from a direct association with sports.

We are talking about deconstructivism, which from year to year, and the collection from the collection is gaining momentum. Monse - the brand is only 5 years old, still, it has already shown itself to be a real ""sower of fashion chaos"" - this is me about deconstructivism.

The collection under the slogan ""we need a smooth exit from the dark times of the pandemic"" turned out to be not too flashy, wearable, and promising that ""changing sweatpants and hoodies"" can also be comfortable.

There are trendy overalls, cargo pants, mini skirts with maxi pockets, a drop of patchwork, an endless row of stripes, and even your own vision of a classic silk dress. 👌🏼Well, it couldn't do without actual trends- dresses with an open back, tops with slits, laces - as a symbol returning 2000s.",0
378,"As part of this project, we will see a limited collection that will be sold at the world-famous resorts - Capri, Forte Dei Marmi, Marbella, Cannes, Miami, Las Vegas, Hawaii, and Rio De Janeiro. 

And the most desirable element of the collection is predicted to be the Ferragamo Studio Bag. Every bag is unique for each of the resorts - the name of the resort is engraved on the shoulder strap of each bag.

For my taste, the bag claims to be a worthy competitor to the Dior book tote (although the novelty is suspiciously similar to the last one😂).  Those who want to join the beautiful on the official Ferragamo website will be able to find a travel diary: illustrations, collages, photos and animations that convey a piece of the local Tuscan culture.

Within the framework of the project, 6 artists from all over the world (France, Spain, Brazil, Korea, and, of course, Italy, or rather Florence) will glorify the print of Tuscan wildflowers.

380,"Today I read the news that Coco Chanel's apartment in Paris has been reopened after a severe restoration. It has become even a little more like an apartment from the times of the hostess's life and plunges into her world even more profound.

Once in Paris, quite a long time ago, I happened to look there, and for me, this excursion ended with a big question. Why does the interior of the apartment, which was so close and dear to the mistress, so strongly doesn't correspond to her sober approach to creating fashion?

Pomp, the theatricality of Art Deco in the interior
                      VS
Practicality and innovation in her fashion

381,"How about discussing one of the most provocative accessories of the coming summer? Chains adorn our waist again! Do not rush to flip through with a thought: ""Well, no, it's not mine!"" 😂

Yes, of course, the first association that we all have is hello from the 90s because it was then that we saw a boom in this style. But ... the 90s are not the only time when you used chains on your belt, and if you are not ready for such decisions, just look for inspiration sooner.

Even at the beginning of the 19th century, during the Empire period, dresses were decorated with chains, decorated with ribbons during the day, and in the evening performance were ""served"" with gems and pearl chains on the belt.

All this I mean is that trends can be interpreted in different ways! 😉 Experiment!

* The tapes of fashion influencers are already full of examples of stylization from the 90s, and if you choose a more elegant option, I recommend that you take inspiration from Chanel.",0
382,"So, they were all asked the same questions.👇🏼

1. What does beauty mean in French?
Opinions were divided - naturalness  without visible efforts VS beauty have no visual features, it is something that is not formulated and defies stereotypes.

2. Why is the phenomenon of the French girl so widespread in the world?

Everyone wants to wake up beautiful without effort, and the modern French style promotes just that. The reason for everything is the desire to be more natural, freer, to make a minimum of effort😝

3. What about makeup?

Here again, it is ambiguous - light natural makeup still wins a little. But 2020 has left its traces here, too - even classic French women want to experiment.

Well, let's draw conclusions.

The French style is free from stereotypes, more often natural, but if the heart demands it, it can be bright and shocking. The phenomenon of the attractiveness of French women is that they look the way they like.

Perhaps trite, but true! 🤷🏼‍♀️",0

How do we style?

For a long necklace to look modern, it is best to avoid🙅🏼‍♀️ styling it with monochrome silhouette turtlenecks, T-shirts, or blouses.

A correct✅ way of stylization was offered to us by Dior and Chanel at their summer shows - a long pendant + a rather formal outfit: over a shirt, tie, with a classic jacket, etc.

In short - the simpler, the better, complex designs of scarves on the head are in the past, well, at least for now, and we give preference to simple solutions. 

Well, it's easier for us.

Method 1

We remove the hair, tie the ends at the back (on or under the hair), and you're done.

And here, it would be appropriate to recall especially relevant in the 2021st way to tie a scarf from Rihanna - the tips should stick out in different sides.

I am happy to share😉

Let's start with the types. I would single out 2✌🏼 main types that are most relevant this year:

1. Classic silk scarves, mostly with geometric or abstract prints.

2. Monochromatic headscarves made of natural materials (linen, cotton, and their analogs) - the maximum closeness to nature, the most natural colors.

Events unfold in perhaps one of the most epic and alluring, but at the same time frightening and repulsive places on our planet - Iceland. Incredible landscapes, sheer cliffs, and a raging sea, ice floes drifting on the blue surface and chaotically scattered over the dark volcanic sand.

""Freedom, sometimes wild and hostile, but FREEDOM!"" - the message of the creative director Anthony Vaccarello.

The collection combines the rock aesthetics of the 90s, the silhouettes of the 60s, and the vibrancy of the 80s.

A special place among all this splendor was taken by jewelry - flashy, shiny, and leaving no chance to miss them! Chains, gems, chokers, elongated pendants, chain belts, layering, and combinations break any stereotypes.

✅ Incredibly feminine like a second skin, especially in nude  shades
❌But at the same time, you need to be prepared that it will quickly highlight the shortcomings🤷🏼‍♀️
❌It is not very easy to combine with other things and requires attention on this issue

Silk dress

✅The most easily stylized dress in the world. It mixes with almost everything - you can put on a jacket, shirt, sweater or cardigan, trench coat, and it would be great to add a turtleneck, a basic T-shirt, etc., under the dress. The shoes are the same -  there are no frames 👌🏼

432,"It turned out to be not so easy to find something from street fur slippers in the middle price segment🤷🏼‍♀️ Basically -  luxury, which is too expensive for a fast enough💨, in my opinion, trend. But there are still 2✌🏼 excellent and economical options😉

🧷brown by Mango - https://bit.ly/2Q7LRFi (in cold weather, we style with socks🧦)
🧷very cute😍 by H&M:
gray- https://bit.ly/3anLXze
cream- https://bit.ly/3sqa2vC

The sole of everyone is relatively high - you can walk on the street, but, of course, they are suitable for the house, so you can experiment, but if it doesn’t work, we can use it to home😉",0
433,"Today we have another shoe trend 2021 - however, the option is not for the faint of heart 😂 2020 has presented us with a new trend, which is at its peak in the spring of 2021 - Slippers!
 
In the spring version, these are primarily fur slippers. For those looking to give it a try, I recommend considering the following options:

- fur mules,
- sandals with fur (like the well-known birkenstock)
- and for the most daring - real fur slippers.

❗️Important advice when selecting ""street slippers"" - pay attention to the thickness of the sole. It is recommended to be quite dense and massive for use outside the house.

434,"The way of sustainability 🌱 is a whole direction of the modern fashion industry, so Gabriela Hirst, in her Fall 2021 collection for Chloe, emphasized environmental friendliness, saying that when creating the latest collection, Chloe reduced the environmental impact by 400%☝🏼 compared to last winter.

Interestingly, the Chloe team found about 50 vintage Chloe items on eBay by creating a collection, bought them, and used them to create new bags👜 Today, I finally looked at those very eco-friendly🌍 handbags in detail, sharing with you.

We take an example, remember hand-made skills, and use ideas.💡",0
435,"And we are again about the topic of sustainability  - H&M also continues to walk along its ""greenway""🌱,  and the guide to this ECO-kingdom in 2021 will be none other than Aria Stark, well, in the sense of Maisie Williams.

The goal🎯 is set - by 2030, H&M will use only recycled or ECO-friendly materials.

Maisie has already posted a video on Instagram where she turns into an avatar and becomes a digital heroine who protects the environment.

The video is inspiring👌🏼 - I liked it, the goal is also good, and the main character impresses me as a whole. Still, the main thing is that it becomes a reality, not a fabulous H & M marketing road.🤞🏼",0
436,"And some ""ballet"" street style for inspiration

#inspirationINVOGA",0
437,"An ideal👌🏼 example of everything we talked about above can be Mango ballet flats. By the way, there you can almost always find affordable options for trendy shoes, and the quality is very pleasing.

Here are some options:

🧷 Medium Brown square toes ballerinas - https://bit.ly/3toS65H 
🧷 Black square toes ballerinas -  https://bit.ly/3dt745r
🧷 Brown square toes ballerinas - https://bit.ly/3dmIyCB
🧷 Wine long toes ballerinas -
 https://bit.ly/3tpSYHq

I really like the saturated colors of both options - ideal for spring days👌🏼

#INVOGAchoose",0
438,"It seems that spring has begun everywhere, and the time to change shoes has finally arrived - we are discussing all the trendy shoes for spring 2021

Let's start with the 🥿ballerina shoes, which in 2021 have their own characteristics compared to the classic pair popularized by Chanel last century.

So, modern ballet flats have the following features:

✔️NO🙅🏼‍♀️ structure, only soft shapes

The structure on ballerina shoes is so absent that they can be easily turned into mules and worn without a backdrop - this pleases - variety and comfort! 👍🏼

✔️Fully closed

In some versions, ballet flats are not even very similar to ballet flats😝 but rather resemble boots.

✔️Absolutely flat sole

✔️Minimalistic decor

First of all, we avoid bright decor, but it is better to exclude any.

✔️Ideally, the shape of the cutout on ballerinas should follow the contour of the shoes' toed.

1. In the morning on empty stomach.

L-proline/L-lysine: When choosing a complex from Solgar, breakfast can be available in 40 minutes. These structural collagen amino acids affect the thickness and density of thinned hair. L-lysine also blocks 5-alphareductase due to which active hair loss occurs.
Vitamin C with bioflavonoids
500 mg.

2. At breakfast containing fats

Omega Xtra: You can drink throughout your life without interruption. 3 g
Vitamin D: The dosage is calculated based on your current level. To normalize metabolism, it is advisable to bring it to the level of 90−100 ng/ml (we do not look at laboratory standards: we take another 25-30% from the result in the tests, this will be your real level)

3. For lunch

Sulfur (MSM): If there is no candidiasis (thrand). If you eat, you don't need to drink sulfur, instead - biotin and silicon (can be obtained from bamboo). 1000 mg
Biotin: If there is a rash on the face, then there is a deficit of B5 - they are competitors for suction. Include B5 in the reception with amino acids or drink it before dinner. 2mg.

4. For dinner

Zinc Picolinat: Course 1.5-2 months. 50 mg

Long thick hair is a dream of many men and women. I’ll share with you what to do if your hair grows badly, what products can be used for topical use in addition to Valerie’s collection.

Improper care, frequent dyeing, perm - these are the main reason of poor hair condition. But hair is also an indicator of our health. Often problematic hair signals ""disorders"" in the body - deficiency conditions, chronic diseases.

1067,"*What Is Vitiligo?**  *Why it happens*  
 
Vitiligo is a condition in which white patches develop on the skin. Any location on the body can be affected, and most people with vitiligo have white patches on many areas. 
 
Vitiligo is caused by the lack of a pigment called melanin in the skin. Melanin is produced by skin cells called melanocytes, and it gives your skin its colour.

The main thing to understand about this care product is that the conditioner itself does not have any regenerating or healing effect, it only envelops the hair with a protective silicone film - but this is a lot!

 ❗ If your hair is longer than 10 cm, then the use of a conditioner is a must after shampooing in order to smooth the hair cuticle and even out the pH!

💦 For thin hair that is prone to loss of volume from the use of a rinse-off conditioner, rinsing with a solution of vinegar is suitable, or using spray conditioners: Bonacure kick moisture spray conditioner, Selective 15 in 1 and others.

💦 Conditioners that are suitable for normal, dense and porous hair: Kaaral Smooth, Kaaral Color, Сutrin Moisture ism, Angel Professional MARINE DEPTH SPA, L'ANZA Healing Moisture KuKui Nut, JOICO Moisture Recovery Conditioner, etc.

1270,"Skin Tag Removal: Home Remedies

Skin tags are very common. According to the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology, scientists guess that almost half of all adults experience them. Luckily, they’re also mostly painless. But how do you get rid of skin tags without calling your doc?

You can remove skin tags at home — but some DIY tips on how to get rid of skin tags aren’t exactly the best advice (never, ever cut them off). ⛔️ ✂️ ⛔️

▫️TEA TREE OIL

This essential oil might help some skin conditions. But there is no reliable evidence that it will get rid of skin tags.

To use tea tree oil on a skin tag:

1. Apply a few drops of the oil to a cotton ball.

2. Place it over your skin tag with a bandage.

3. Leave it on for at least 10 minutes three times a day.
It might take a few days or weeks before your tag falls off.

▫️BANANA PEEL

Don’t toss away your old banana peels, especially if you have a skin tag. The peel of a banana can also help dry out a skin tag. This may be due to the antioxidant properties found in them.

Place a piece of banana peel over the tag and cover it with a bandage. Do this nightly until the tag falls off.

▫️GARLIC

Garlic helps improve the appearance of skin by reducing inflammation. To naturally get rid of a skin tag, apply crushed garlic over the tag, and then cover the area with a bandage overnight.

Wash the area in the morning. Repeat until the skin tag shrinks and disappears.",0

 *This is how to do it:*  
Put a little bit of apple cider vinegar on a cotton wool pad and carefully rub it onto your skin tags. Repeat this a few times a day. If you add this to your daily routine, you’ll start to notice that the skin tag will change color; it will get darker. If, after a while, it has gone black, the tag will fall off quite quickly. The dark color means that the tag has dried out. Give it a try; it really does work!

It actively works on hair texture to augment hair volume. Ingredients such as Haritaki have anti-fungal and antibacterial power to fight all kinds of infection on the scalp that stops hair growth. Besides, Triphala can even lower dandruff which is the main cause of unhealthy hair and growth.


2. Stimulates Hair Growth
Deprived digestion, inopportune health conditions, and limited bowel movements can also obstruct hair growth. Triphala aids in digestion and delivers proper nutrients that are essential for the scalp and hair. As such it indirectly increases hair growth and fortifies follicles.


3. Gives Natural Shine To Hair
Pollution, dust, and UV rays lessen hair’s natural shine. Moreover, internal and external toxins make hair damaged and give it a dull look. Taking Triphala flushes toxins and restores hair’s shine. Amla, which is present in it aids in closing the hair pores or cuticles and locks the fatty acid present in the roots of the hair.",0

Peppermint oil, which contains menthol, is considered one of the best options for soothing itchy skin. Its cooling properties can help reduce itching caused by bug bites, poison ivy, and even hives. 
Moreover, this oil can also be used to ease itching related to diabetes, liver disease, and kidney disease. 
A 2016 study revealed that participants felt relief from itching when using peppermint oil coupled with petrolatum. Experts recommend that essential oils like peppermint oil should ideally be diluted in a carrier oil before you apply them onto the skin.",0

- Washing your hair often will make your hair thin, is a myth. Wash them often with a mild shampoo, especially during this weather as our hair becomes dirty and oily, which can cause dandruff or fungal infection
- Avoid wearing caps during work out, because you sweat a lot while exercising and a cap does not let the sweat dry out which in turn can cause a fungal infection.
- Always use a serum after washing your hair, it controls the frizziness of the hair and provides shine.
- Choose a shampoo as per your hair type. If you have oily hair, you can use a mild shampoo. For dandruff, one can use a little strong shampoo with a post-conditioning treatment.

2250,"Check What You Put On Your Lips Do you ever pay attention to what you put on your lips? There is a myriad of lip-enhancing products available today. From lipstick to lip balms and lips gloss, there are tons of ways to get those pouty and sultry lips. You will also find lip plumping lipsticks on the market. And we subject our lips to all these without a single thought. It is a bad idea. These products contain chemicals, some may be too harsh for your lips and that might just be the reason for your lips turning dark. Check all the lip products you own. Throw out the expired ones and the ones that contain petroleum jelly, mineral oil, parabens, oxybenzone, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). We cannot stress enough on how important it is for you to know your ingredients. Go for lip balms and lipsticks with natural and organic formulation.",0

A cleansing oil might seem like the last thing you need but it’s a game changer. It breaks down sebum, dirt, and makeup while adding moisture.

A good option is sea buckthorn berry oil, a remedy proven to control excess sebum.1 You could also try jojoba oil which is believed to mimic sebum on the skin to “trick” sebaceous glands into producing less sebum and help keep oil levels balanced.

Before the close of another academic year we would like to preserve the memories of the year gone by. For that we ask you to send us the most memorable photo in your phone’s gallery along with a caption. It can be a group photo or a photo of picnic in a park with your classmates or a selfie or your graduation photo or it can even be a photo of one of HSE's buildings. We will make sure that those photos will be cherished forever.

The photo should have a connection with HSE. Either is taken inside HSE’s premises, like classroom or dorm or any of the buildings. Or it is taken with your classmates. Please share the picture here: https://forms.gle/79KUzw2r8kc81qaY8

As you are aware about the evacuation of dorms today due to a threat of terrorist attacks, we are briefly sharing university guidelines on what to do during a terrorist attack:

Firstly, inform the university officials and police on following emergency numbers as soon as possible:
Police (OVD): 102
Emergency: 112
HSE Helpline: +7-(985)-040-13-55

1. If you see a suspicious object 🎒📦🧸
- Do not touch it
- Block of the location and evacuate

2. If you receive a threat via call  ☎️📲
- Note the caller's number
- Record, if possible (or write) 

3. If you receive a threat in writing 📝📰
- Try not to touch it 
- Preserve in polythene/plastic

4. If a device explodes 
- Keep your chest, stomach covered
- Remove tie, scarfs, neck wear to avoid strangulation 
- Help in rescue efforts

5. If there is a hostage situation 
- Evacuate where possible 
- Don't counteract or negotiate with terrorists 
- If necessary, follow instructions of terrorists if it won't endanger lives

6. If there is gunfire
- Lie on the ground and find cover 
- Keep your face away from windows doors
- Cover your head with hands
- If bleeding, try to stop it using a cloth

7. When asked to evacuate
- Immediately collect personal effects (money, passport etc.)
- Put on outside clothes (not to freeze)
- Follow instructions 

You can read safety measures in detail here

Just don't panic and be safe ❤️",2

5301,"​Российские власти проведут для школьников и студентов патриотический урок: расскажут о Великой отечественной войне и напомнят, что в Украине расцвёл неонацизм

Петербургские вузы получили письмо от министерства науки и высшего образования. Министерство требует провести 19 апреля единый урок: рассказать учащимся, как во время Великой отечественной войны нацисты и «их пособники» устроили геноцид советского народа. Это нужно для того, чтобы не позволить западным странам выиграть информационную войну за умы российской студенческой  молодежи, говорится в письме министерства. 

Привлекать к участию в уроке планируют детей с 12 лет (об этом говорится в методичке, которая есть в распоряжении «Ротонды»). По итогам урока школьники и студенты должны написать пост в соцсетях: осудить действия нацистов по отношению к мирному населению.

В методичке также приводят слова, которые должен сказать преподаватель в конце урока: «Настоящее даёт нам горькие примеры проявления нацизма, неонацизма, геноцида в отношении отдельных народов. Яркие факты неонацизма сегодня мы видим в США, Европе, некоторых странах Латинской Америки, Украине».

Согласно документу, организаторами урока выступили «Агентство социальных технологий и коммуникаций» и движение по увековечению памяти погибших при защите отечества «Поисковое движение России». Первая организация часто проводит «патриотические» мероприятия — например, она создавала патриотический форум «Растим гражданина». Руководительница этой организации Елена Родионова выступает учредителем московского регионального отделения Общероссийского народного фронта.",2

We have 6 language tables in a bar - English 🇬🇧, Russian🇷🇺, Italian🇮🇹, French 🇫🇷 , Spanish 🇪🇸 and German 🇩🇪 . You can grab a beer/cocktail 🍺🍸 and join any table to meet new people, practice languages and share your cultural experience in an informal environment 🌍🍻. We are meeting on regular basis every 2 weeks in a pub  called Tap&Barrel 📍, usually on Wednesdays from 20:00 till 00:00. We know some people have classes till 21:00, please don’t worry if you gonna be a little bit late.

5592,"There are less than two days left before the Electoral Commission of the Student Council of HSE stops receiving applications for CISA.

So, what is CISA? It is the Council of International Students Association. Formally - a bilingual representative student government body of international students. Factually - a team of superheroes supporting you and solving specific issues you face.
Last year they conducted research on international students' employment, launched a magazine for international students, worked on complaints, analyzed the quality of services for international students, and did anything to protect you and your rights! They have allies in administration and the Student Council of HSE but are the first station that tracks the problems, as those who experience them themselves.

But there is a threat: we still have not enough applications, and if that remains until Sunday 12th, 23:59, CISA could not be formed, so the title is true.

So, why should YOU join CISA? Let us give a word to current CISA chair, Syeda Ulya Ehsen Kazmi:

""First and foremost, because you are an international student and the issues of international students affect you in one way or the other. CISA provides you with a platform to work on those issues and come up with ideas for the better. It is where you can amplify the voices of international students and add weightage to their concerns. Join CISA if you care and want to contribute to the HSE international community!""

5879,"@JekaCheloveka let people introspect, we can't please everybody and not sure if we are answerable to everybody. 

People are vacinnated, and or had Corona. Not sure if they are not vaccinated how they can enter Russia. 

But anyway that's my argument and not going to entertain further more. 

We are all responsible and mature enough (adults) to make decision. And nobody is forcing it on anybody. 

All the clubs have preponed their parties from say 28-29-30th to 27th and we are doing the same. 

Rest let them introspect.",2
5880,Come on. Most of the people in this chat go out every weekend to crowded bars. And suddenly we are asking if it's okay morally? This party would actually consist of 99% vaccinated people at least,2
5881,I think the idea of the question was a bit different. :D,2
5882,The party was actually moved not ahead but backwards 1 day,2
5883,The question is not breaking the law no matter how stupid it may be,2
5884,"Just introspecting, what good does moving party ahead will do. Not trying to spoil the mood, but holding a party with 120 people sure doesn’t send a virtuous message. I know everything is booked and so on, still.",2
5885,"‼️🆘‼️

Important update. 

From next week HSE is going online completely. 

Also, to abide with the rules and laws we have moved our party for 27th of October. 

We have booked the LOFT, HALLOWEEN PARTY is confirmed. We just want to make sure that we are not interrupted midway by authorities hence we are playing safe by moving it on the 27th. i.e Wednesday!

We have 120 students already registered. Those who are registered will receive email shortly with the price they have to pay for ticket and where they can meet us, as next week classes are online and hence we are not allowed at University. 

Let's have a freaking unforgettable Halloween probably last party of this semester! (Hopefully not the last)",2

5889,Or sometimes (like this year on sept-oct) many received it at the end of the month just by going to the visa office and ask them to check whether it was ready or not,2
5890,"It depends, they say is an estimation for the minimum working days needed to process it, but from personal experience I have received my visa after 3 weeks of submitting my docs (1 week before the official lockdown last year), and also up to 4-6 weeks regularly",2
5891,"I have a question regarding the visa for those who already prolonged theirs.
I have a single visa, and  I have applied for the multiple entry visa few weeks ago and they have told me that it will take 5 weeks minimum. So is this a realistic timeframe or did you wait much longer? I'm planing something and this information would be really helpful.",2

Our HALLOWEEN PARTY IS ON! 

Date : 28th October

Time : 10:30pm 

This message is to let you all know that the registration link will be on exchange students WhatsApp chat and tomorrow it will be posted here for everybody else .

As being Esn we are giving preference to our International Students as it could be a last party that we are organizing for them.

However, we want to be fair and will post link here as well for you'll to participate.",2
5893,"🔴 Attention all 🔴
Due to the worsening of epidemiological situation in Moscow, the stand up comedy show has been postponed until further notice. We will laugh, that too soon. Until then, stay healthy and stay safe.",2
5894,thank you,2
5895,"from HSE, fyi: ""Revaccination with Sputnik Light is allowed 6 months after the first complete vaccination. For vaccination on the territory of the HSE it is necessary to have a SNILS. You can get it in any department of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation. They do it quickly. Without SNILS you can't get a QR code""",2
5896,Yes too much vaccination can harm you!,2
5897,It is,2
5898,I think*,2
5899,I think you 6 months is recommended between the second and third dose anyways💉,2
5900,🤷‍♀️,2
5901,Dangerous?,2
5902,"Revaccination with any Sputnik vaccine is allowed only 6 months after the complete vaccination with any other COVID vaccine. You will not be able to vaccinate earlier than January. It is dangerous""
⬆️The ""medicine"" project manager of HSE replied. (I got my Pfizer second dose in August)",2
5903,Everyone has to go to a different clinic… so look at the stamp of your certificate,2
5904,This clinic.,2
5905,"I got it at GUM
It was free for foreigners then but they asked me to go to another clinic to get my QR code.",2
5906,It is just because officially vaccine starts to “work completely” only 21 days after vaccination,2
5907,which clinic?,2
5908,You get sms with QR code after 21 days but like I said you can visit the clinic and they can print it on the same day or ask you to visit 2 days after..,2
5909,"Now, it's almost impossible. Better get SNILS, it also helps in getting a QR Code.",2
5910,Even have this.. so I can travel freely 😎,2
5911,Did anyone without a russian SNILS get their vaccination already at HSE?,2
5912,Thank you two,2
5913,"Usually 21 days to generate a link on sms but if you go directly to the clinic you can get it within 3-4 days.

This is my personal experience..",2
5914,It may appear the same day,2
5915,No more than week just for clinic to process information about your vaccination and load it to the system,2
5916,Yes,2
5917,do you get the QR code right after the vaccination or yo you have to wait some time?,2
5918,"So if you have been fully vaccinated with a European vaccine, can you just get Sputnik Light here and receive the QR code?",2
5919,100%,2
5920,Is this secure information?,2
5921,"opened the second link, found this haha",2

Anyway, it is business as usual until next Thursday currently :)",2

To be updated about future restrictions",2
5925,Nothing is updated yet :D,2
5926,"On current rules? Or on equivalence of vaccines?

There is no equivalency of vaccines currently. If any institution lets you in with EU Green Pass that's technically illegal but the level of tolerance will vary depending on the place you're going to. Strictly technically only vaccination administered in Russia by Russian-approved shots (Sputnik and its derivatives and two other questionable ones) currently counts.

Let me try whether English versions of Moscow website or covid prevention website are updated at this moment",2
5927,"Do you know where we can find any news? is there a reliable website in english??
I am trying to get news from my embassy website, but still nothing there...",2
5928,"If it can of interest to anybody, 2 weeks ago they were asking for the QR code to enter the Cosmonautics Museum at VDNK. We showed our European green pass (I have Pfizer), they checked it against my passport and they let us in. Of course it depends on the person you find, but I don’t think everybody will be asking for the actual “Russian” QR code",2
5929,"They won't count for QR anyway, so at this moment this is only for those who travel.",2
5930,"I know some clinics, as well as ones which do Pfizer, but not sure it’s totally legal",2
5931,"If you could get a legal foreign shot in Russia, it would be valid for QR codes. Since no foreign shots are valid for QR codes, logic dictates you cannot obtain one legally here :)

There were talks of importing some by foreign clinics, but those are still that - talks. And they would cost a pretty sum of money.",2
5932,I also have never heard about it,2
5933,Same question,2
5934,++,2
5935,Where in Russia it's possible to have Moderna?,2
5936,"Because in Russia it’s possible to get the moderna shot, apart from the Sputnik so it should release a valid QR code as well",2
5937,Does Moderna vaccine give you QR code?,2
5938,"Bro I'm talking about generic parties not just Esn parties.. 

We are working on to see how we can fit Halloween party as about the future we don't know and hence want this party to be amazingly good if it happens..",2
5939,so keep it at 499 and all is fine 😅,2
5940,"yes.... ""Вводится обязательное использование QR-кодов при проведении массовых мероприятий, на которых присутствует более 500 человек.""",2
5941,In Moscow?,2
5942,why? are there more than 500 people?,2

Hopefully we can have Halloween party and make it the grandest",2

So a lot of people I see here",2

5950,thank you!!,2
5951,I’ll advise you to buy the tickets quite soon and to leave before the 28th if you really want to,2

5953,not true,2
5954,"For flying you don't need the test, but for visiting cafes and museums in different cities — yes, kinda. Every region has it's own rules",2

6077,It doesnt show values or culture,2
6078,"An entrance of 300 rubles with a beer included, makes it a just for money event?",2

6086,"Then you do not need to find arguments, start polls or whatever",2
6087,Where is the problem to wait for the rules 😂,2
6088,I guess we can do a poll and see what the 300 people think ),2

6090,I’m liking it too. Open discussion is so much fun,2

6096,How a party that i am organizing is just for money? I’m not obligating anyone to go,2
6097,We also can help by sharing your posts via our social networks if you write to us and ask for help,2
6098,I'm not saying that you cannot do it. But there is a difference between events. Even commercial can be posted if it shares values and culture not just for money,2
6099,I guess we can create a separate group where anyone can share non ESN related events and announcements.,2
6100,"Ok, thank you.",2
6101,"Hi all again 
I want to clarify this situation and close it forever. 
When the creator of the chat transferred ownership to Julia the responsibility for this group lay on ESN. 
And we will set some rules about posts. We will think about them and announce for everyone. 
We are working not for commercial purposes and trying to provide best experience of being in Moscow/Russia.
My apologies to Maria that we didn't  tell her before deleting the post.",2

6107,Mute it)),2
6108,"Don't understand this comment because who is forcing people? 
Certainly we are not doing it for money and even recommending other parties where you can go.",2
6109,is it possible that you create an own little group to discuss your problems and dont annoy 303 students in this group with your problems?😅,2
6110,I don’t understand the harm in me sending a poster,2
6111,just fun and volunteering,2
6112,Then?,2
6113,Money or no money. Let people decide which places to go to,2
6114,+,2
6115,our intention is not the money,2
6116,"Thank you for recommending bars, I have been in Moscow for 7 years, and I decide to plan a Halloween party to because my best friend is a dj and I need money )",2
6117,"I don’t understand why to erase a poster… anyway people decide them selfs… like, what is the harm? You, yourself said it’s “mostly” that means not only.",2
6118,"There are many parties happening in Moscow. We definitely don't consider yourself or any as competition Maria because we only want to provide positive experience through Esn. 

If you really want a Latino party I would recommend Casa Agave or Liberty Bar and they are in the center not at the end of Moscow. 

Cheers.",2
6119,"In any case, the girl who started the group transferred ownership to an ESN member, so I guess it's up for them to decide the new policy in the group",2
6120,😂,2
6121,Yes,2
6122,"I guess they see it as a competition, as if they didn’t already close the numbers on their party.",2
6123,Did they delete an event you posted?,2
6124,"I don't think so, but I don't know, maybe this has now become an exclusively ESN event group",2
6125,"I think it's great that ESN is organising so many events, but I don't think it's ok to prevent anyone else from doing it",2
6126,So I don’t have to create my own group if I want to share information about a party that I am organizing?,2
6127,And we started with organising random BBQs and other parties,2
6128,"Dear All, please feel free to share this group between friends & internationals who would be up for any kind of stuff😃🥳",2

6318,Maybe they forgot to write sub there?,2
6319,Plus it’s Karo.Art which is always in English,2

6321,Stupid kinopoisk,2
6322,Hm,2

6354,"But all right. I'd also love to see A quiet place, but I don't know where to wath it in English",2
6355,"You call being picky: knowing what you want, and then boast it as a positive trait)",2
6356,sorry apparently  i’m picky today,2
6357,"Oh honestly i’ve seen a lot of his movies and this is the one and only director who puts me asleep… It was really hard to study him, cause I’m definitely not the person who sleeps whatching movies, but Lynch is a magician:D",2
6358,"Cool, thanks for the recommendations!",2
6359,"A David Lynch room would be awesome! but what I was talking about was a David Lynch movie, since there are two good ones that I haven't seen playing in Сатурн in English tonight: TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME at 19:00, and Eraserhead at 21:45",2
6360,"If you're interested in quests, highly recommend ""Дуракъ"", ""Русалка"". Great actors, full of actions and emotions. If you're getting panicked quickly, not recommended. If you want something not scary, but a brain teaser, go for ""7 загадок фараона"". Interesting quests and interior, more like a Indiana Jones film inside pyramids😜",2
6361,David Lynch room is gonna be hard a think based on his movies:D,2
6362,why don’t we just meet at a bar and save the spooky staff for good old Halloween?,2
6363,Oh i’m not fond of scary escapes room (i noticed with time i got more scared of these things) but i would love to see a scary movie. A quiet place 2 for example,2
6364,"@lesyaislesa  and @Bl1ts , would you guys want to see a movie or try to get out of an escape room tonight?",2
6365,"David Lynch is more like a phycological, art house, drama, thriller, rather than horror. Have you guys seen Twin peaks?",2
6366,I wanted to go paintballing,2
6367,I don’t like spooky stuff either,2
6368,I can join if you'll hangout after it,2
6369,I'm actually out of the horror activities 😅,2
6370,"Now the question is, who wants to go do anything of the aforementioned?",2
6371,"We could do the Stalker one, unless you guys prefer something else: https://mir-kvestov.ru/quests/world-of-quests-stalker",2

6385,We were three or 4 people,2
6386,I tried eacape room three months ago,2
6387,Well I don't know that the escape room situation is like in Moscow right now. Last time I've been was five years ago.  But I think we should gather at least five people and book it ahead of time.,2
6388,Excape room sounds cool,2
6389,Sounds cool,2

6501,"Guys, I am not sure if i'd join tomorrow - so if there are brave people who want to go for sure (weather seems ok but some risk), can I please pass it on to you to define when to meet where?

I can give a reference point:
4pm @Кузьминки (Kuzminki) Metro Station Exit 4. Whenever a seating area is defined, it would be nice if the location can be shared in this Chat.

To bring: food for you, to share if you want

tbd: are there grills or does someone have a potable one?

tbd: Does anyone want to meet ;-)",2
